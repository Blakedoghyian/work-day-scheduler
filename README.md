# Work Day Scheduler Criteria

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
* THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist

## Description

Here is a functioning scheduler with timeblocks for normal business hours. Click one of the text boxes to enter any task or reminder, and press the save button. The list will update the color of the timeblock automatically to represent past, present, and future tense of your task. Feel free to refresh or come back to the page to see your saved tasks will persist until cleared.
